There was a time when few animals species were at the edge of extinction. Many of them got extinct whereas few survived. All thanks to human beings for both cases. Now there is one more thing  which is at risk of extinction and that is Humanity!! Yes, you heard it right…!! Many of us think that if humans are alive so is the humanity but that’s not true because what all is happening nowadays in our country and even across the Globe is forcing us to rethink over the concept of Humanity. Whether it is the cruelty with animals, rise in pollution level, climate change and so on endless issues, all these are enough to prove that we all are losing our Humanity.
</p>
<p>
Now let us focus on one of the worst crime i.e RAPE….oops I hope I didn’t cross the limits set by our society. After all, a word like this and victim of this incident are seen negatively by our society. So how do you define a Rape..? Is it just a physical assault of a woman? No, it’s not just the harassment of a woman but also the harassment of her family,her personal life as well as her social life. This 4 letter word is enough for destroying someone’s entire life and if somehow the victim try to overcome this incident, our so-called modern society is always ready to not let them live a better life again. As a human, I always wonder how can someone make his mind to do such a disgusting thing. I always wonder what could be the reason behind the increase in the number of rape cases in our country? </p> Most of the criminals and few of the educated people believes that the dress or clothes of girl is one of the main reason of rapes. Many of them also believe that allowing girls for late-night parties and events is also a main reason for rapes. I would like to ask you that if dress of a girl is the reason behind the rapes then why the women wearing “Burkhas or Sarees” have also been raped. Let me tell you, that the clothes, parties, age, modernity etc are not the reason for this crime but the Mentality of a human being is the only reason for this heinous crime.</p>

Some of the factors influencing the mentality of a man towards such crime as believed by our society and criminals:
<ul>
<li>More amount of Adult and Pornographic content in Movies and Digital Cinema.</li>
<li>No proper lessons by parents to their son regarding the respect of a woman.</li>
<li>Personal grudge of taking revenge from the girl or woman.</li>
</ul>
<p>
According to the report of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), over 33,356 incidents of rape were reported during 2018 involving 33,977 victims, an average 89 rapes daily. In 2017, 32,559 rape cases were registered, while in 2016 the number was 38,947 but the conviction rate for these cases is very very low. If we talk about few cases in past some years which includes Nirbhaya case(2012), Shakti Mill Ganga Rape(2013), Asifa Rape Case(2018) and so on, then we also have to focus on the current situation of these cases. The 4  out of 6 accused of Nirbhaya case were punished for “Hang Till Death” by the court but still after 7 years. </p> It is known to all how they played with our judiciary system by filling petitions one by one so that they can extend the Punishment Date. We all must accept that the response of our System is very slow towards the rape cases. In many cases, the parents of the victim are frightened for not filing case whereas, in some places, the Police itself is not ready to file the case. So under such circumstances, how a victim can get justice? How the criminals can be punished when our system acts in such a way against such crimes.? The questions are endless and so is the rape cases in our country.
</p>

<p>As of the ‘IndiaSpend’ article;
    <UL>
<LI>44% of college students “agree” that women have no choice but to accept a certain degree of violence.</LI>
<LI>51% of college students believe women must mainly take care of the household and bring up children.</LI>
</UL>
Few people have such mentality and they call themselves as educated. Great..!! Have you ever thought that what we as a youth are doing against such crimes? Whenever such crimes take place, the only thing we do is “Candle March”. Even the news channels will bother only for few days. But just think what the victim and her family have to go through in their daily life. After all, rape is the only crime where the victim is usually seen as a culprit by our society. "Might that girl have encouraged the boy", "She used to come home at late night from the parties", "Have you ever noticed the clothes she use to wear?"... these are the few common comments people usually pass for the victim. Due to social pressure, many victims even don’t file a complaint against the culprits and in few cases, they even commit suicide. 
</p> Around 3 years ago, a video got viral in which a man was raping a girl in daylight and that too in a public place and what people were doing was just making the video and ignoring the crime as nothing is happening. Shouldn’t we feel ashamed that we live in a country where at one hand we worship girls during festivals and on the other hand we are not concerned for their safety?
The encounter of the 4 criminals of Hyderabad Gang Rape case was a perfect example of how to treat the criminals of such crimes. Though it was opposed by some people and the Hyderbad police was blamed for violating the laws, I feel it to be the best solution for Rape criminals.</p>

<p>
So, what could be the other solutions for preventing this crime? According to me, the following points should be considered for reducing rape cases…
<ul>
<li>First of all, the Education and awareness against rape should be spread throughout the country and especially in the remote areas by taking initaitives from root level.</li>
<li>Teaching a girl how to protect her self is important but teaching a boy not to harass a girl is much more needed.</li>
<li>Don’t ever think that since you are married so you have all right to force your partner for a physical relationship.</li>
<li>The Police Department should have a separate department for dealing with the Rape cases which should be headed by a lady officer.</li>
<li>The Judiciary system of our country should respond quickly and fairly against such cases.</li>
<li>Most important, the punishment of rape should be very strict just like we have in other countries.</li>
<li>The women and girls should be treated with all respect in all fields like Cinema, Private jobs, Sports, etc.</li>
<li>A rapist shouldn’t be forgiven just because he is a minor. A minor accused should be given more harsh punishment so that he don’t even think to repeat the crime.</li>
<li>Instead of making devices for women safety we should try to make an environment and a nation safe for women.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
All sections of society should come forward against such crimes and this doesn’t mean to do a Candle March but to unite together and fight for the justice of the victims. We shouldn’t elect those leaders for the assemblies who have criminal records. Let’s make our country again “A Golden Bird” by reducing the crime rate against the women. Its high time to take action against those who are the culprits of such crimes. A woman is the most important part of our society so we have to make a safe and comfortable environment for her. It should be made sure that rape victims should not face any humiliation in a police station or at hospitals. The victims should be allowed to live with dignity and without any shame and the criminals should be punished.
 I hope that this blog will leave an impression on your mind and will make you rethink over the crimes on the 
woman in our country because if the women of a country are not treated with respect then the country can never develop…!!</p>
