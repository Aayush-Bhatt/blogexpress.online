<p>Savitri is an 11-year-old girl. She likes to read books and often spend her time in the house despite playing outside like her age group children, when someone visit's their place she feels shy to greet them and does not get easily comfortable with new people also prefers to talk less. All this states that she is an introvert. This evening she has been invited to a b' day party in her neighborhood, hearing that she immediately neglected the offer and started panicking and sweating. As the time approached to reach the party she started feeling restless along with unfit stomach, her mother somehow managed to make her up to the party provided that she will accompany her. At the party children were excited and being very bawdy except Savitri, she refused to talk to or indulge in any conversation or activity. When met with an aunty who forced her to sing a poem her heartbeat rose, mind went blank and soon she burst into tears composed with fear.</p>

<p> Now, what this could be? Yes, this is what we call social anxiety fear of speaking and presenting before people, moreover in front of new people and settings with constant worry about embarrassment & humiliation. The psychologist has classified it as a chronic mental health disease that occurs when external stimuli affecting our behavior are associated with social gatherings, interactions, and presenting before people. It is somewhat different from normal shyness or coyness. This disorder is often misdirected as shyness. To understand its symptoms well let’s first try to differentiate between normal shyness and social anxiety.</p>

<p> The only difference which could be stated is the reaction of an individual when severe shyness is accompanied by negatives thoughts and emotions social anxiety could be easily sensed whereas being is a personality trait and many people deal with it with ease and perceive it just as a negative trait. Frequency differs in shyness and anxiety. Physical symptoms may include rigid body structure, blushing, stomach ache although shyness is about being timid.p</p>
<p> MAIN SYMPTOMS ENCOMPASSES- fear, self-consciousness, concern for embarrassment & humiliation, the worry of being judged, fear of depression, restlessness, blushing, blank mind, stomach aches, sweating & in some situations even crying, low self-esteem, short of breath, shaking, panic, rapid heart rate are some of the common symptoms. Talking of – not being able to connect with your external stimuli and people around you, different cognition from others as for e.g. Presentations might be a nerve-racking thing for people diagnosed with social anxiety but a normal routine task for others. All this results in the emergence of negative thoughts, low self-esteem, occasionally some people are prone to depression.
</p>
<p> Now, let's go back to Savitri. What do you think could have caused her social anxiety? Being an introvert she has never been exposed to such huge gatherings and always has avoided participating in n social settings. As in her case not be able to open up easily to anybody plays a factor in her been subjected to anxiety, facing new people. Introverts have a hard time opening up, adjusting to the environment out of their comfort zone they mostly prefer their own company and limited interruptions. Disturbances in her lifestyle gave rise to anxiety. Apart from that causes of social anxiety or any other psychological disorder are diverse ranging from behavioral, cognitive, humanistic, biological, and psychodynamic SOCIAL ANXIETY INCORPORATE Family history – one is more likely to develop social anxiety if your biological parents or siblings have the condition Negative experiences – emotional or sexual abuse New demands /stress – social or work Big events – the death of close ones, trauma or disaster are some amongst the common causes.</p>
<p> Despite the fact that, Social anxiety is a curable disorder, under the guidance of therapist and patience visible results could be seen. Some of the suggested therapies by psychologists are – cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, mediation. Several other measures could be adopted to combat the condition like deep breathing, goal orientation, dealing with negative thoughts, and emotions by planning for the future situation. Taking tiny steps and gradual shifts are recommended despite big goals, challenge yourself, avoiding alcohol, reducing intake of caffeine and quitting smoking indulging in physical exercises along with healthy diet could really help in self-diagnosis working with optimism is one of the main key features as it is said </p>
