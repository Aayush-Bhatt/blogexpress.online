<b>How one can strengthen habits of Saving Money? </b> <br>

By knowing the importance of saving money, most humans want to save their money, but without a
perfect plan and good habits, getting diverted and falling short of financial desires is easy. Sometimes the
hardest thing about saving money in India is just getting started. When decided it is time to start saving
money, people begin searching for high-quality ways of saving money. Some start looking for a
jackpot that leads them directly to wealth and happiness.
 </p>

 <P>
Thus everyone's journey to success is a bit different, but there is one thing common amongst all successful
people is good saving habits.
Like so many things in life, placing money aside as savings is a habit that
wishes to be developed. If you are having trouble getting into the habit of saving, you can follow a few
money-saving hints that might help you to build saving habits and achieve your goals.
</P>

<p>
Now let's understand how one can develop a saving dependency with the example of a person named X
who just started his career. Now X has a dream to own a house, car, travel around the world, and build a
corpus for retirement. To acquire all his goals, he needs a considerable amount. He knows that to make
this wealth, he has to save. But due to his impulsive spending habits, he loses his earnings without even
realizing. For a young investor like him, it's challenging to preserve motivation to save for a long term aim
like retirement, which is too far for him. Rather he is tempted towards immediate joys and pleasures.
<b>However, X can develop saving habits by following a few steps.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Set Achievable goals </b> - <br>
One of the main problems in saving is not having a goal. It is indispensable to set a specific goal that will
drive you to a culture of saving. Without understanding the purpose of saving money, it is hard to stay
motivated and tons easier just to spend it. Hence first, X has to create some achievable goals that supply
purpose for his money. As we discussed earlier, X has a goal of living a luxury life, so he wants to estimate the 
required cost to achieve those goals and assign time limits to keep him motivated.
</p>

<p>
<b>Record Expenses  </b>- <br>
Secondly, he needs to track all his expenses to parent out where his money is going and how he might be
able to allocate better. Each month, X wishes to record everything he and his family purchased the use of
credit card statements, bills, and bank account statements to make sure they're accurate. He can use a
notepad or spreadsheet to track expenses. There are additionally some free-spending tracker tools which
can also be used.
</p>

<p>
<b>Eliminate Unnecessary Savings  </b>- <br>
Now, as all costs are known, he has to make sure that all purchases are in line and what he wants. After
noting all his expenses, he can now pick out non-essentials that he can spend less on, such as dining out
or watching a movie. Need to negotiate on bills that can assist him to reduce fixed monthly expenditure
like cable, internet and phone service so he can put more money into savings.
</p>

<p>
<b>Budget for Savings</b>- <br>
Once X has the thought of how much he spends a month and how much money he can save. He needs to
create a layout of his money and has to stick to it and also need to prioritize the things that are vital to
him and develop a strategy for his money and limit overspending. Now he is aware of how much he can
save. The best way of saving money and placing it into better use and increasing them at the same time is by
investing in appreciating belongings or high yield accounts.
</p>

<p>
<b>Automate savings  </b>- <br>
Automating savings is one of the easiest and best methods of saving money and also for developing
saving habits and helps to stick to the plan barring getting diverted. As X has already chosen where to
invest, now he needs to set the automatic transfer of cash straight from his paycheck or have a portion of
money go into his savings account whenever he makes a deposit. Setting up an automated transfer to
saving account forces him to save money before he has a threat to spend it.
</p>

<P>
<b>Watch savings grow  </b>- <br>
Now, X has set up a savings plan to passively work at the back of the scenes and allow his money to work
for him. He should also review his budget and check his progress each month to help him stick to the plan
and identify and fix issues immediately. During this process, he might even find more ways to store and
reach his goals faster.
</P>

<p>
 <b>Reward yourself</b> -<br>
After reaching positive milestones depending on the length of his intentions, rewarding himself will help
him to tune his progress and keep him motivated. There must be a small reward and he shouldn't simply
blow all his savings while enjoying it.
</p>
<p>
  
</p>
<b>Conclusion: </b> <br>
Just like the example, anyone who is serious about saving cash and wants to develop the habit of saving,
these strategies would possibly help them to start saving. It is never too late to start saving money. It may
additionally be difficult in the beginning, but you will soon get used to saving, and it will become a
addiction and a natural way of living. Little by little, you will begin to notice that the adjustments you
