But what about Indians, they do not have any insecurity from
dark complexion still they are obsessed with ‘fair skin’, why?
Well, in India it is more about how you look rather than what
you are, these kinds of social norms led to the formation of
uneasy principles in society and one of them is a higher demand
of fair skin. Companies like fair and lovely have billion-dollar
turnover every year by selling fake formulas of fairness and
people are buying it because that’s what society demands. You
can often see matrimonial ads with boldly stating “Gora Rang
Hona Chahia” (we want a fair-skinned groom or bride). This
inexplicable obsession for fairness led many people to put
The general perception can be understood from the show
business where you rarely find someone with the dark
complexion to get big roles and is popular among the
mainstream, why? Because people only want to watch a shiny
and glaring skin artist appear on the screen. But this notion
is slowly changing, the new generation now prefers acting skills
over the skin skills.
The fight for racism is 
unnecessary efforts on changing their skin colour so they can
too fit well among the racist society. And all of this has
become so common that people do not even think to oppose it,
they have accepted this as the ultimate truth of life, an
an unalterable fact which cannot be challenged by anyone.
If we think that racism is because of a lack of knowledge and
awareness than we are wrong! Educated people are
more tilted towards racism even after being well aware of the
the fact that skin colour is a result of cells called ‘melanin’ and this
perception is quite terrifying. Discriminating and not liking
someone because of their skin colour shows that 10 million years
of human evolution has not brought sufficient sensibility in the
humans to understand the notion that colour is nothing more
then just ‘a colour’ and it does not define their nature, habits or
attitude.
going to be very long, it will take time
to break the old traditions and customs, as a popular phrase in
English says ‘Rome wasn't built in a day’, but with the
consistent efforts of the new generation we can end this soon.
The popular comedian Zakir khan(who by the is dark) said in
one of his podcast, “Mai Jarra Hi Sahi Mera Wajood Toh Hai,
Hua Kare Samandar Meri Talaash Mai” which means do not lose
Four Minneapolis police officers on May 25th forgot to embrace
the above quote when they choked down George Floyd, an
American black for counterfeiting bills. This cruel event led
people around the world to think about what Martin Luther King Jr.
said about racism 60 years back. The fight for racism is not
new, people from centuries had to suffer just because they
have a darker complexion. If we go deep and think about it,
racism is not just about skin colour discrimination rather it is a
subtle way of saying that you are inferior to us in every
manner, whether it is knowledge, class, appearance, and much
more. Racism is a result of insecurity, jealousy, and opportunity
crisis of so-called ‘white people’, who deep down is afraid of
other races to take up their jobs and place in the society. You
can find traces of racism around the globe but this is more
prevalent among Americans, maybe because everyone is running
towards America for a better future.?
your identity because someone doesn’t like it, be the way you
are and someone will cherish you.
