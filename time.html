“We should accept the fact that we are in a state of war or else we may face a big problem very soon”
</div>
<br>
<p>
Belonging from an Army background, I was always told that you have a good life with all free facilities. Well that's only the half truth because only we know what our family has to deal with every day. I have seen my mother crying whenever my father’s vacation used to get over. Whether it is the dense forest of Assam or the Mountains of Ladakh, I have witnessed the courage of my father. Trust me, it requires a lot of guts to stay away from your family for 6-8 months and that too when you are not sure about your life. So it's very sad to see that few people think that the life of a soldier or his/her family is easy. They don't know that our most lovable person is standing at the borders so that you and I can sleep peacefully at our home. <br> 
Now lets come to the topic which forced me to write this blog and express my grief and anger to you all. On 14 Feb 2019, when we were busy celebrating the love, our brave soldiers sacrificed their lives for us. The PULWAMA ATTACK shocked every person in this country. Let me tell you about the incident. A large convoy of CRPF was hit by an SUV car carrying around 300 kg of explosive accompanied by gun firing. Due to this attack, our 40+ brave soldiers got martyred. Though this is not the first time when Pakistan has shown its cruel side but we should assure that this time we should give a suitable reply. Ever imagined that how a mother will be able to see a dead body of her son, how a sister will accept that she lost her brave brother and how a father will react when he will get to know about his son. But we, the Army family have one great thing that even after losing one son in attack or war, we are ready to send another son to the Armed Forces.
</p>

<p>
<u> PULWAMA ATTACK (14/06/2019)</u> <br>
Before ending this article, I have few questions for you, for countrymen,for Government and especially for the News Agencies & for the Human Rights Associations:
<ul>
<li>Why did our intelligence system fail to stop this pre-planned attack?</li>
<li>Why did the Government and politicians still believe in Official Talk with Pakistan?</li>
<li>Should we have to ban the sports and trade relationship with Pakistan?</li>
<li>Why the Government does not allow the Armed forces to take actions according to them?</li>
<li>Why the hell News and Newspaper agencies telling that our soldiers were killed? </li>
<li>Aren’t they this much educated to distinguish between the Killed and the Martyred or Killed-in-Action?</li>
<li>What could be the best solution for tackling these type of Terror Situations?</li>
<li>Why none of the Human Rights organizations who used to feel pity on terrorists, condemned this attack?</li>
<li>Why stone pelters are not being punished whenever they try to obstruct the operation of Armed Forces?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
So, what could be the solution to these kinds of terrorist attacks? Should we talk with Pakistan or should we show them the power of Indian Armed Forces.? Should we go to the UN or should we proof the world the strength of Indian Armed Forces? Probably, the answer is to show the World that what our defecse forces are capable of. Enough of Political and Diplomatic talks, now its time for serious action. We have enough Army power to defeat any country but we never tried to attack anyone instead we always believed in peace. But vo kehte hai na ki “Laato ke bhoot baato se nahi mante”, so this is the correct time for the reply of an attack with a more powerful counter-attack. It is the time to sweep out those demons from the valley and the neighbouring country. It is the time to show the powerful face of Hindustan because if we believe in Lord Buddha then we also have belief in Lord Rama. I am not asking for the war with Pakistan but want to see our Armed forces eliminating each terrorist from the Valley and our Defence forces are doing this very efficiently.
</p>

<p>
One more thing which is very important that whenever these kinds of terrorists attacks takes place, we get angry but only for few days and after that we act like as nothing had happened. So is news agencies, for 2-3 days they will show all the news regarding the attacks and martyrs but after one week, even they will stop bothering about our soldiers. This mentality has to be changed because the only thing our soldiers wants from us is our constant support and we really should support them.
According to Wikipedia, this was the 99th terrorist attack on our country…!! We have to accept the fact that we are in a state of war. We have to take the actions very soon or it will be too late for us. And one more thing to tell you that you people can donate money to the family of martyrs through the Govt. App named as BHARAT KE VEER. We the people are now full with anger against Pakistan but we should not forget that we also have some traitors inside our country who are playing a major role in promoting terrorism in India and those evil-minded people should be treated in the way that they deserve.
</p>

<p>
Now it’s really the Time to Terrify the Terrorists and to send them back to their "Aaka" but not alive. Instead of cheering “How's the Josh” we should now prove that “How real is our Josh”. Let’s stand together with our soldiers and their families against terrorism and make this country “TERRORISM FREE”. I request you to keep all the political and social differences aside and pressurize the Government to take strict action against terrorism. <br>JAI HIND.!
